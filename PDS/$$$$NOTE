Sam,

  By the time you receive this I will have uploaded a file,
DRStuff.zip for inclusion on the CBT.  This file has an ISPF tool
that made for many successful system recoveries of the system
during D/R testing.  We generally recovered 100 volumes with FDR
in about 4 hours time including the time spent configuring the
restores with the ISPF tool.  As I told you before my company has
made a decision to outsource its mainframe and I must leave with
it.  I am trying to hold onto my e-mail address while I am in the
process of finding a new position.  I have packaged every bit of
JCL that drives the tool, the MS-Word procedures and the ISPF
tool itself.  I appreciate your time and effort in preserving the
work put into this.

Thomas Hutchins
