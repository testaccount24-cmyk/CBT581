Note on $ALLDOCS member:

   The $ALLDOCS member is an XMIT-format file of a pds.  All members
of this pds are Microsoft WORD documents.  In order to read these
documents, you have to download them in BINARY to a PC, and use at
least Word 97 to read them.

   To convert this member to a pds, issue the TSO command:

   RECEIVE INDS(userid.FILE581.PDS($ALLDOCS))

and if you're under ISPF, prefix this command with the word TSO, as in:

   TSO RECEIVE INDS(userid.FILE581.PDS($ALLDOCS))

Note on $DRSTUFF member:

   This is the original zip-format file sent by Tom Hutchins.

   To use it, download it to the PC, and unzip it there.

   Naming conventions will be PC conventions, and not MVS conventions.

   I have included this material here, to help you with recovery,
if you would need the original materials.
