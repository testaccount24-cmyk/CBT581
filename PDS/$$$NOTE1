Notes on deploying this package:

The following members contain XMIT-format unloaded pds'es:

  EXEC
  ISPANEL
  ISPSKEL
  ISPTABL
  JCLJOBS
  JCLLIB

And the following member contains an XMIT-format unloaded sequential
dataset:

  JCL01

To create the datasets you will need, execute the TSO commands of the
type:

  RECEIVE INDS(userid.FILE581.PDS(member))     for each member above

and you can rename the datasets as you go, and put them on the proper
volumes, by answering the prompts with:

  DSN(dataset.name.you.want) VOL(volser)

or you can let these names default to userid.RECOVER.** on whatever
volume they will land, and you can rename them later.
