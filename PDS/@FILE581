//***FILE 581 is from Thomas Hutchins, and contains a complete      *   FILE 581
//*           Disaster Recovery system, automated under ISPF.       *   FILE 581
//*                                                                 *   FILE 581
//*           Documentation for this system is currently in Word    *   FILE 581
//*           format, so unfortunately, you have to do a TSO        *   FILE 581
//*           RECEIVE command against the $ALLDOCS member, and      *   FILE 581
//*           download each member of the resulting PDS, to the     *   FILE 581
//*           PC in BINARY, and look at it using Microsoft Word,    *   FILE 581
//*           at at least the Word 97 level.                        *   FILE 581

//*           As an alternative, I have included the original       *   FILE 581
//*           ZIP-format file as well - member $DRSTUFF.  You       *   FILE 581
//*           can download this member in BINARY to the PC, and     *   FILE 581
//*           unzip it there, obtaining the DOC members directly,   *   FILE 581
//*           together with everything else, in its originally      *   FILE 581
//*           submitted format.                                     *   FILE 581

//*        By the time you receive this I will have uploaded a      *   FILE 581
//*      file, DRStuff.zip for inclusion on the CBT.  This file     *   FILE 581
//*      has an ISPF tool that made for many successful system      *   FILE 581
//*      recoveries of the system during D/R testing.  We           *   FILE 581
//*      generally recovered 100 volumes with FDR in about 4        *   FILE 581
//*      hours' time including the time spent configuring the       *   FILE 581
//*      restores with the ISPF tool.                               *   FILE 581

//*      I have packaged every bit of JCL that drives the tool,     *   FILE 581
//*      the MS-Word procedures and the ISPF tool itself.  I        *   FILE 581
//*      appreciate your time and effort in preserving the work     *   FILE 581
