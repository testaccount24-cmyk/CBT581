                            %D/R HOT-SITE Volume List

+  This is the main dialog for the generation of JCL, job submission and
+    job checking for the Disaster Recovery process. Commands are entered
+    to initially add the number of volumes that will be restored.  A fast
+    path dialog is utilized to quickly enter the names of the volumes
+    being restored and type of restore.  Limited error checking on
+    duplicate named volumes can be done. A process of building all of the
+    jobs through a skeleton can be done.  Jobs can be checked for
+    completion.  The entire scheme can be redone by a command to remove all
+    the volumes and generated JCL.  JCL can also be generated to secure the
+    volumes after the recovery by initialization.
+
+  Line commands are also available to do many of the above commands but
+    on an volume by volume basis.
